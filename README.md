# Muscle.css

###WAT?
Muscle is a responsive flexbox css library to quickly 
prototype layouts and elements. It presupposes that you 
have some working knowledge of flexbox.



###WHY?
I was sick of redefining the same flex attributes
over and over again while prototyping, so I made this 
for my own projects and figured I'd share it.
